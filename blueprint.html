<!-- This is where I'm outlining my plan for making this thing.
The page needs to display:
    a title
    instructions
    number of wins
    blank _ _ _ _ for incoming letters of that word that fill with letters when the user answers correctly.
    number of guesses left
    letters already guessed

We need a bunch of words to solve, stored in an object, I think, and then each word is an array of the letters.
We need to set up events to pick up key strokes and record them.
We need something to generate a bunch of _ _ _ for each word based on the length of the array.
We then need something that can replace a _ with the correct letter.
We need to compare the users answer to all the letters in the word. If the letter is in there, we display it.
    If the letter appears more than once, we should show all occurances at once.
If the guess is wrong, we subtract a try. If they run out of tries, they get a new word.
The letters already guessed displays only the wrong letters.
